# What's This?

This is just a cool little [YomiHUSTLE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2212330/Your_Only_Move_Is_HUSTLE/) mod i'm working on.
I like open source a lot. 
So i'm making this one public as a resource for those who want to learn!

# Disclaimer

I'm not so sure if IvySly in particular would be ok with this. 
But as you can see in the .gitignore i've ensured that only my modified assets will appear in the public github.
If by any chance there is an issue with this contact me on Discord (GudBoiNero#6650) and i'll make it private.
